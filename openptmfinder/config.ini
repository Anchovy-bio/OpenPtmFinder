[PATHS]
protein_db = /home/kopeykina/search_modification_project/openptmfinder/data/db.fasta
; Path to the FASTA file containing the protein sequences.
unimod_db = /home/kopeykina/search_modification_project/openptmfinder/data/unimod_tables.xml
; Path to the XML file of the Unimod database.
grouping_file = /home/kopeykina/search_modification_project/openptmfinder/data/group_df.csv
; Path to the CSV file used for grouping samples.
aa-stat_dir = /home/kopeykina/aa_stat_results_TMT/banner/

mzml_dir = /home/data/syn7170616/Data/Proteomics/TMT/mzml/
; Directory where the mzML files are located.
pepxml_dir = /home/data/syn7170616/Data/Proteomics/TMT/open_search/

; Directory where all output files.

[PARAMETERS]
type_of_modifications = 2, 7, 8, 9
; A comma-separated list of Unimod classification keys (numbers) to filter for specific types of modifications. For example, '2' is a "Post-translational" modification, and '7' is a "Co-translational" modification.

name_of_modifications = Phospho, Deamidation, Hydroxylation, Methyl, dihydroxy, Hex, Acetyl, Fuc
; A comma-separated list of modification names to search for. These names must match the 'code_name' attribute in the Unimod database XML file.

localization_score_threshold = 0.3
; The minimum localization score required for a modification to be considered valid. Peptides with a score below this threshold will be excluded from the analysis.

mass_tolerance = 0.012
; The mass tolerance (in Da) used when matching a modification's mass shift to the experimental mass difference in the pepXML files.

fdr_threshold = 0.05
; The False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold applied to filter peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the pepXML files. PSMs with an FDR greater than this value will be discarded.

type_tmt = TMT11plex
; The type of TMT labeling used in the experiment (TMT10plex, TMT11plex).

min_group_for_stats = 5
; The minimum number of data points (e.g., PSM intensities) required in each experimental group (e.g., TMT_group1, TMT_group2) to perform statistical tests.

calculation_pval = True
; A boolean flag (True/False) to enable or disable the calculation of p-values for statistical significance testing.

sorting_pepxml = True
; A boolean flag (True/False) to apply an additional filtering step on pepXML PSMs based on `hyperscore` and `expect` values.

nproc =
; The number of parallel processes to use for computation. If left empty, the program will use the number of CPU cores available minus one.

port = 10005
; The network port for the web server to run on, if the `--run_server` flag is enabled.
